# Medical Store Management App

You are to build a fully functional, modern Windows desktop app for managing a medical store.

## Goals:
- Lightweight, smooth performance on low-end PCs
- Fully offline (no internet required to run)
- Clean, modern UI with smooth animations
- Easy to compile into a standalone `.exe` file
- Modular, maintainable code

## Tech Stack:
- Python 3.10+
- PySide6 (Qt for Python) for GUI
- SQLite for local database
- QSS (Qt Style Sheets) for theming
- PyInstaller for exe building
- MVC architecture (UI, database, business logic separate)
